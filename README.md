## 🌟 About Me


## 🔧 Technical Skills & Focus Areas

### 📊 Data Science

I use data as a foundation to generate insights, support decisions, and design impactful strategies.

- Skilled in **data cleaning, transformation, and analysis** using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and hypothesis testing for business understanding
- Visualize trends and KPIs using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Proficient in **SQL** for analytics, cohort analysis, and retention tracking
- Build storytelling around data to communicate insights clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences
